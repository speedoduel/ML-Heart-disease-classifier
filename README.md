# ML-Heart-disease-classifier
A ML project where we use different classifier in python to find the most accurate in python to predict wheather the patient will have stroke or not
We extensively used all Jupyter notebooks for this project and we took classifier like Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Random Forest and K nearest neighbors Classifier
to see the most accurate one for the dataset in this project and then predicted if the next patient might be at risk with an accuracy of 85.2%
